# Appostolic ‚Äî Capabilities ‚Üí MVP Cut Matrix

> Purpose: Take the Core Pillars (long‚Äëterm) and map which parts are **In MVP**, **Post‚ÄëMVP (v1)**, and **Future**. This guides coding focus without cluttering the high‚Äëlevel architecture doc.

## Legend

- ‚úÖ In MVP (must be present for initial launch)
- ‚è© Post‚ÄëMVP (v1; important soon after launch)
- üîÆ Future (valuable later, not required for initial adoption)
